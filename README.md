`lcm-gamepad`
=============

A basic LCM gamepad/joystick publisher.

I'm tinkering with this to simplify the pilot controller for MESOBOT, but
hope to produce something fairly generic. Later I'll probably port it to ROS
or something with flatbuffers & nanomsg/0mq or similar.

My initial development will focus o the PS4 DualShock controller, because
that's what I have handy. MESOBOT has used the Xbox One controller in the
past, so I'll probably tackle that second.
